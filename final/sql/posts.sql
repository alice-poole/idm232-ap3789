On the side, roasted carrots and lightly creamy, golden raisin-studded rice perfectly accent the sweetness of the glaze.\r\nGet Cooking\r\n4 Boneless, Skinless Chicken Breasts\r\n1 Tbsp Ancho Chile Paste\r\n2 Tbsps Crème Fraîche\r\n3 Tbsps Golden Raisins\r\ntried-and-true\r\nkitchen tools\r\nGarlic Press\r\nSlicing garlic has never been simpler. This two-sided essential is designed to do two jobs in one: crush garlic and slice it. Made by Harold Import Company, a family-owned American business with over 50 years of experience, this easy-to-use press owes its incredible durability to its heavyweight, stainless steel construction. To use it, simply place the clove in the hopper and press downward for freshly pressed garlic, or flip it over to get uniform slices of garlic. And to ensure minimal mess, it includes a handy cleaning tool for removing leftover pressed garlic after use.\r\nPlace an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 450°F. In a\r\nmedium pot, combine the rice, a big pinch of salt, and 1 1/2 cups of\r\nwater. Heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, cover and reduce the heat to\r\nlow. Cook 12 to 14 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed and the rice\r\nis tender. Turn off the heat and fluff with a fork. Cover to keep warm.\r\n2 Prepare the ingredients & make the glaze:\r\nWhile the rice cooks, wash and dry the fresh produce. Peel the carrots;\r\nquarter lengthwise, then halve crosswise. Peel and roughly chop the garlic.\r\nRemove and discard the stems of the kale; finely chop the leaves. Using a\r\npeeler, remove the lime rind, avoiding the white pith; mince to get 2\r\nteaspoons of zest (or use a zester). Halve the lime crosswise. Halve the\r\norange; squeeze the juice into a bowl, straining out any seeds. Whisk in the\r\nchile paste and 2 tablespoons of water until smooth.\r\nPlace the sliced carrots on a sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil and season\r\nwith salt and pepper; toss to coat. Arrange in an even layer. Roast 15 to 17\r\nminutes, or until tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven.\r\nWhile the carrots roast, in a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 2\r\nteaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the chopped garlic\r\nand cook, stirring constantly, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until fragrant. Add\r\nthe chopped kale; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally,\r\n3 to 4 minutes, or until slightly wilted. Add 1/3 cup of water; season with\r\nsalt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until the kale\r\nhas wilted and the water has cooked off. Transfer to the pot of cooked rice.\r\nStir to combine; season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover to keep warm.\r\nWipe out the pan.\r\n5 Cook & glaze the chicken:\r\nWhile the carrots continue to roast, pat the chicken dry with paper towels;\r\nseason with salt and pepper on both sides. In the same pan, heat 2 teaspoons\r\nof olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned chicken and cook 4 to\r\n6 minutes on the first side, or until browned. Flip and cook 2 to 3 minutes, or\r\nuntil lightly browned. Add the glaze and cook, frequently spooning the glaze\r\nover the chicken, 2 to 3 minutes, or until the chicken is coated and cooked\r\nthrough. Turn off the heat; stir the butter and the juice of 1 lime half into\r\nthe glaze until the butter has melted. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\r\n6 Finish the rice & serve your dish:\r\nTo the pot of cooked rice and kale, add the lime zest, crème fraîche,\r\nraisins, and the juice of the remaining lime half. Stir to combine;\r\nseason with salt and pepper to taste. Serve the glazed chicken with the\r\nfinished rice and roasted carrots. Top the chicken with the remaining glaze\r\nfrom the pan.

But how do you know if it\'s\r\ndone? There are numerous ways to test the doneness of your noodles when\r\nthey’re cooking. Some folk wisdom says to throw a piece of pasta against the\r\nwall; if it sticks, it\'s done. As much fun as we had experimenting with this\r\nmethod, we found the best way to test the pasta was, shockingly, by tasting it.\r\nIn Italian, \"al dente\" means \"to the tooth,\" meaning that it\'s still slightly firm\r\nto the bite. As your pasta cooks, periodically (and carefully) taste a piece of it.\r\nIf it\'s still too firm, let it cook a little longer.\r\nIn some of our recipes, we specify to remove the pasta from the pot when it\'s\r\n\"just shy of al dente.\" This is because, later, the pasta will be cooked in a\r\nsauce. Removing the pasta from the water just before it\'s al dente will ensure\r\nthat the final product isn\'t overcooked.\r\nClick for Tablet View\r\n1 Prepare & roast the broccoli:\r\nPlace an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 450°F.

Columbus brought the tropical root crop back to\r\nEurope from the Americas. It was eagerly adopted by Europeans and given\r\nthe title of “potato” (from the indigenous Taino name, “batata”). Years later,\r\nin 1537, when the white potato first arrived in Europe, locals began referring\r\nto both vegetables as “potatoes,” creating a confusion that persists today.\r\nSweet potatoes are enjoyed in both regular and \"baby\" varieties—smaller\r\nversions of the vegetable that are renowned for their sweet flavor and tender\r\nflesh.\r\nClick for Tablet View\r\n1 Prepare & roast the sweet potato:\r\nPlace an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 450°F.

But how do you know if it\'s\r\ndone? There are numerous ways to test the doneness of your noodles when\r\nthey’re cooking. Some folk wisdom says to throw a piece of pasta against the\r\nwall; if it sticks, it\'s done. As much fun as we had experimenting with this\r\nmethod, we found the best way to test the pasta was, shockingly, by tasting it.\r\nIn Italian, \"al dente\" means \"to the tooth,\" meaning that it\'s still slightly firm\r\nto the bite. As your pasta cooks, periodically (and carefully) taste a piece of it.\r\nIf it\'s still too firm, let it cook a little longer.\r\nIn some of our recipes, we specify to remove the pasta from the pot when it\'s\r\n\"just shy of al dente.\" This is because, later, the pasta will be cooked in a\r\nsauce. Removing the pasta from the water just before it\'s al dente will ensure\r\nthat the final product isn\'t overcooked.\r\nClick for Tablet View\r\n1 Prepare the ingredients:\r\nFill a medium pot with water; add a big pinch of salt and heat to boiling on\r\nhigh. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Cut out and discard the core of the\r\ncabbage; thinly slice the leaves. Peel and roughly chop the garlic.\r\nPat the shrimp dry with paper towels; season with salt and pepper. In a\r\nmedium pan, heat a drizzle of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the\r\nseasoned shrimp; cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until opaque\r\nand cooked through. Leaving any browned bits (or fond) in the pan, transfer\r\nto a plate. Set aside in a warm place.\r\nAdd the sliced cabbage to the pan of reserved fond; season with salt and\r\npepper. (If the pan seems dry, add a drizzle of olive oil.) Cook on mediumhigh, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until slightly softened. Add the\r\nverjus and 1/4 cup of water; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring\r\noccasionally and scraping up any fond, 3 to 5 minutes, or until the cabbage\r\nhas softened and the water has cooked off. Transfer to the plate of cooked\r\nshrimp. Wipe out the pan.\r\nWhile the cabbage cooks, add the pasta to the pot of boiling water. Cook,\r\nstirring occasionally, 9 to 11 minutes, or until al dente (still slightly firm to the\r\nbite). Reserving 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water, drain thoroughly.\r\nWhile the pasta cooks, in the same pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on\r\nmedium-high until hot. Add the chopped garlic; season with salt and\r\npepper. Cook, stirring constantly, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until softened\r\nand fragrant. Add the tomato sauce, 1/3 cup of water, and as much of\r\nthe chile paste as you’d like, depending on how spicy you’d like the dish\r\nto be; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 4 to 5 minutes,\r\nor until thickened. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\r\n6 Finish & serve your dish:\r\nAdd the cooked pasta, cooked shrimp and cabbage, and half the\r\nreserved pasta cooking water to the pan. Cook, stirring vigorously, 1 to 2\r\nminutes, or until coated. (If the sauce seems dry, gradually add the remaining\r\npasta cooking water to achieve your desired consistency.) Turn off the heat;\r\nstir in the crème fraîche until thoroughly combined. Season with salt and\r\npepper to taste. Top the finished pasta with the almonds and a drizzle of\r\nolive oil.
